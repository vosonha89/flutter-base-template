# Local Services

This directory contains services that handle local data operations:

- **Database Service**: Database access and operations
- **Preferences Service**: User preferences and settings storage
- **Cache Service**: Data caching mechanisms
- **Encryption Service**: Data encryption/decryption utilities
- **Local Authentication**: On-device authentication handling

These services provide abstractions over local storage mechanisms and handle data persistence operations for the application.

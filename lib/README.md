# Lib

This is the main source directory of the Flutter application following a clean architecture approach.

Key components:

- **app.dart**: The root widget of the application
- **main.dart**: The entry point of the application
- **core/**: Shared functionality across features

The features are located in a separate top-level directory. This architecture promotes:
- Separation of concerns
- Testability
- Scalability
- Maintainability

# Tests

This directory contains all tests for the application including:

- **Unit tests**: Testing individual functions, classes, and methods
- **Widget tests**: Testing UI components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Testing interactions between components
- **Golden tests**: Comparing UI screenshots for visual regression testing

The test structure should mirror the lib directory structure to make it easy to locate tests for specific components.
